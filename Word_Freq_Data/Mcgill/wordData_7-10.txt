i just found the paperwork lady from monsters inc.  %^$ is it too soon or can i start asking cute girls to have late night pokemon go adventures with me %^$ 
lying in bed, thinking of the stupid things you've done %^$ i'm gonna masturbate so fucking good tonight i can't wait to get home %^$ that feel when you wash off all your sweat at the end of the day %^$ the struggle when the show's really boring but one of the characters is really hot %^$ does anyone know of a good cream for getting rid of scars? %^$ massaging your boobs after getting that bra off at the end of the day %^$ hijabs are wack as hell.  %^$ 
team instinct is way too underrepresented in montreal  %^$ i think its time to break up with my girlfriend. %^$ hey guys. i am from toronto. people here are stupid and the guys that try to talk to my girlfriend are pussies. scared of me. 1 guy.  %^$ stereo tonight %^$ 
don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head. %^$ omg deadpool is a hilarious movie %^$ what's the difference between drinking to forget and taking those fcking pills to forget how much pain you bear inside  %^$ came across 6 other people playing pokemon during the hour i was outside... at 2 am  %^$ 
and uh melissa? watch out for bears! %^$ 
go talk about pokemon go on reddit or facebook - i'm sick of being bombarded by your inability to deal with the real world  %^$ hate for something you don't understand is what causes shit like homophobia... you don't need to like it to coexist with it ... %^$ same goes for anything else really. people always hate on the people who dress up in weird costumes etc... like it doesn't effect you so why do you care so much?  %^$ if you don't like something, no need to hate on it... like what's the point of calling everyone who plays pokemon go losers... they aren't hurting anyone, they're having fun... leave them be lmao  %^$ this mah credo: no ragrets  %^$ 
the september apartment rush is gonna be lit  %^$ when the dude constantly crying about pokemon go and "bad yaks" is actually generating more "bad yaks" and pokemon go content  with the constant whining %^$ 
if this city wasnt full if such sleazy dudes. it would actually be a nice place.  %^$
