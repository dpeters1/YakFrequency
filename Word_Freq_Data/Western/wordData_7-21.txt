49 fun fact of the day: the human brain remains half-awake when sleeping in a new environment for the first time. this explains why it's hard to fall asleep for the first time in another bed. %^$ when you high key hate your ex but low key still think they're hot....  %^$ it's easy to think you're doing ok when you haven't seen your ex since the breakup months ago but now with a high probability of us running into each other i'm not really sure how i feel.... %^$ loreen "i'm in it with you" and "paper light revisited" are beautiful songs hit her up  %^$ harvey's duck painting  %^$

i really hope you're having a fun and somewhat relaxing summer.  %^$ so i'm a passable cd and am about to suck my first dick. will it make me feel more girly? i feel it will  %^$ 
great. another post about feminism :/ let's all play it out. angry feminist comments, then gets rekt. ugh. how many times will we do this!?  %^$ i wish feminists could learn to take objective criticism, and not just start name calling. being against feminist does not equate to being anti-equality, nor does it mean you hate women.  %^$ build the wall! %^$ work underpaid me so i come up short for rent this month. i don't know how to make this money quick without selling sex. %^$ 
apple and the fbi have no problem taking down kickass torrents but they can't find enough info to prosecute hillary. rrrrrright.  %^$ wish we could talk today. it's okay.  %^$ still waiting for apple to come out as a social experiment to see how overpriced and shitty you can make a product relative to the competition but have it still sell with stellar marketing. %^$ blm is a domestic hate group.  %^$ 
lets get political, political %^$ any vulnerable girls wanna chill? %^$ why does everyone fight about trump vs hillary when the election is not even for our leader %^$ let's get political %^$ when i attend school with such filthy minded disgusting trolls  %^$ when all western's "draft my schedule did" was get my hopes up for classes i couldn't get into  %^$ 
i have spent the past 7 hours vaping and playing roller coaster tycoon ok %^$ when yak gets political >>>>>>>>>> %^$ trump has said that he is a great business man. has tons of business partners. but not a single one has stepped up to endorse him. not one personal friend outside of his family has given anything %^$ trump was chosen as the republican presidential candidate, it will be recorded as a worst incidents of republican. if trump is elected  president, it will be recorded as a worst incident in history %^$ cruz didn't turn on anyone. trump is helping hillary. you have to speak with common sense. and if you're a real republican you would see that trump has made a zoo out of the party. %^$ i cannot understand any educated america would vote for trump or endorse him, i am simply speechless at the complete lack of humanity and self respect. %^$ trump's supporters at the rnc are the same people desperately trying to hide a woman's sign that said "no racism, no hate". we're headed right for nazi germany and the world is laughing %^$ when your faculty fucks you over and updates your module checklist in the middle of course selection.  %^$ 
western course selection starter pack %^$ the last time i got drunk i ran around telling people about the clitoris 10/10 would do it again  %^$ where the heck can possibly find a hookup right now? %^$ your image is being processed %^$ trump seems to have triggered one special little snowflake on here lmao.  %^$ 
we get it. you like trump.  %^$ why is trump taking up my feed? %^$ we get it. you don't like trump.  %^$ i low key respect ted cruz because he refuses to endorse trump. man has principles, even if he's a squirrelly son of a bitch. %^$ i liked ted cruz and still do. i now understand why he didn't honor the pledge. trump never apologized for the personal attacks on his wife or father. i'm not an anti-trump person but cruz has class. %^$ so bernie sanders did the right thing by setting aside his differences and giving his endorsement but ted cruz did the right thing by standing up for his beliefs and not giving his endorsement? what? %^$ best youtube comment after cruz's speech at the rnc: "looks like trump's limos come without cruz control." %^$ if trump wins, i will make an attempt for my life. does that mean trump drove me to suicide? %^$ why is theslutwhisperer even a thing? %^$ 
 %^$ so when melania plagiarizes, everyone shits on her, but when a leftist does the same thing, everyone is suddenly silent. fucking regressive left hypocrisy, and no, i'm not a drumpf supporter. %^$ they're opening a pot dispensery in london!! 601 dundas street %^$ forgive me for this guys. my gf is on this app a lot. she loves this stuff and games! see how long till she knows it's me %^$ so yikyak is 70% rw. interesting.  %^$ 
smooth move ted cruz %^$ just watched cruz' speech and it slayed my fucking life. i would not support him as president but he stuck to his guns and thats admirable %^$ the real crime here is that bernie has officially endorsed hillary.  though we all knew he was an old fart and wuss this whole time. he couldn't even defend his microphone from two blm whores.  %^$ obama is a cowardly woman. trump is a fucking lion. let's make america great again bitches.  %^$ 
oh silly jim!  %^$ here's to hoping that yak would be a lot more serene with tsw/aquadic %^$ *shitpost* %^$ who wants to have sex? %^$ i imagine this is how gay men see vaginas %^$ i just got special permission to get back into my program from being undeclared without even asking for it. does this normally happen? %^$ idk which is worse. the fact that there's a pidgey at a funeral home or the fact that i know it's there %^$ 
is it reasonable to sell a 13" retina macbook pro for $999 %^$ first date ideas other than dinner, i was thinking just go out and grab a few drinks but that might be a bit of a cliche too. %^$ poor people make good firewood.  %^$ if you're shopping at old navy you're probably poor. stop being poor! %^$ dear gays, the left have deserted you for islam. join us and let's make america great again!  %^$ i would definitely go to bars more often if they served better drinks. %^$ feminism is cancer.  %^$ remember when the top yak used to have 200 to 300 up votes? %^$ 
i used to hate "i hate women". then i saw how other men treat women. so now i just say "i hate people".  %^$ when your gf breaks up with you a couple days before an exam  %^$ ladies, get it right %^$ hi yik yak community !! i'm looking for a roommates to take on 3rd year with this coming september. looking to expand my horizon and meet new ppl %^$ stop being poor, and start being fabulous.  %^$ what happened to that guy at the end of december who sent a dick pick to his sister then she told their mom? any updates? the guy just stopped responding... %^$ please let star trek be good!! the trailer looked like absolute shit.  %^$ vote "no" to monica's ex-boyfriend's wife in 2016.  %^$ 
what happened to westernnudes? %^$ god bless whoever is using their lure module in class right now  %^$  %^$ feel like my boyfriend doesn't even want to be with me anymore  %^$ anyone want to hook up %^$ anyone else hate when they just suddenly get very horny for like no reason? %^$ 
ok plz explain to me why everyone is making a big deal over path 3240 and why you wanna make another 800 person class in year 3. this is not gonna make the course easier #widespreadofdata %^$ mood rn %^$ i'm pretty confident that trump has purposefully made sure that something bad happens at the convention just so people actually watch and talk about an otherwise somewhat irrelevant and ignored event %^$ tsw slid into my dm's earlier today and i was absolutely star struck %^$ 
chippy got the munchies %^$ nothing like a good 6 pack.  %^$ london needs a cheesecake factory %^$ bionicbat spotted in kingston %^$ sound familiar? by the mentor of obama and clinton. %^$ guys, have you ever seen your best friend's wiener? %^$ pathology straight causing riots  %^$ i had a dank wank %^$ i'm gunna name my future child mayonnaise  %^$ wow if yak let you post that pokemon porn pic, i wonder what else they would let you post now %^$ 
truth or dare? %^$ usa usa usa %^$ i hate the fact that i can't battle the nearby pokmon, nor the other player and be able to up my pokmons cp and my xp  %^$ i actually think tsw is a girl %^$ read the new yorker article "trump's ghostwriter tells all." disturbing piece from someone who would know him very well. america is in trouble if he's in charge %^$ why'd western yikyak slow down? other cities are doing okay %^$ guys, what do you wear to bed? curious here %^$ i totally thought trump running for prez was a joke a year ago.... %^$ 
i just spent 400 dollars on 2 hot ass prostitutes that i didn't even have sex with because i spent the hour smoking weed and laughing with them. %^$ ivanka nailed it tonight. minus her mentioning the bogus wage gap bullshit.  %^$ look at option two. exactly. theory confirmed. %^$ let me get this straight, you think it's more dangerous to give nuclear codes to a guy who sounds angry when he speaks than to a woman who on multiple occasions risked national security information? %^$ earlier today some girls stopped in their car  and sang some song that went like "i want you" and pointed at me. really made my day. %^$ trump is really trying to get these lgbtq votes while having pence as his vp.  %^$ #theyoungturks #rncincle %^$
