%^$ to those who believe all muslims are terrorists: what goes through your mind? you see a terrorist attack & think we all rejoice? you know isis has killed/trapped more muslims than anyone else right? %^$ regardless of your political or religious beliefs, we all agree this was a horrible crime. :%^$ the trumptrain has been halted and the proof is in the threads %^$ gun laws in the united states is the bigger issue than which religion is wrong or right.  %^$ if u wanna blame ppl then blame ppl but don't blame an entire religion when the majority of that religion hasn't and wouldn't involve themself in terrorism and is actually more victim to it than you! %^$ so this guy had no real religious belief. so what, did you guys just jump to hateful conclusions??  %^$ lol y'all see islamic terrorists like the rest of the world sees american white people , how's that for ironic  %^$ why is it when this shit happens we all take it out on each other & spread more hate. ppl died. we all agree its wrong right? cant we have 1 moment of peace in remembrance w/o insulting eachother? :%^$ i'm the only one at the gym... does that mean i'm the most jacked one in the gym!?! %^$ what's been forgotten in all the political posting is a condolence to all the victims in orlando. i recognize there are many atrocities worldwide, and on a larger scale than this one, but bc of recent %^$ damn did not expect the reactions i'm seeing out of the western yak community  %^$ shoutout to all the lurkers on this app. i appreciate you. %^$ to that girl who was working at the mcdonald's on the corner of highbury and hamilton yesterday, i wanted to say that you are so goddamn beautiful but i was too nervous %^$ so much ugliness in this world. and all caused by the people.  %^$ for picking courses for next year, can you get online help from a guidance counsellor?
